They have brightened our room, that is spacious and cool, 
With diagrams used in the Idiot School, 
And Books for the Blind that will teach us to see; 
But mother is happy, for mother is free. 
For mother is dancing up forty-eight floors, 
For love of the Leeds International Stores, 
And the flame of that faith might perhaps have grown cold, 
With the care of a baby of seven weeks old. 

G. K. Chesterton
